# yaml-cpp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jbeder/yaml-cpp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jbeder/yaml-cpp) [![Documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/jbeder/yaml-cpp.svg)](https://codedocs.xyz/jbeder/yaml-cpp/)

yaml-cpp is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) parser and emitter in C++ matching the [YAML 1.2 spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).

To get a feel for how it can be used, see the [Tutorial](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/wiki/Tutorial) or [How to Emit YAML](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/wiki/How-To-Emit-YAML). For the old API (version < 0.5.0), see [How To Parse A Document](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/wiki/How-To-Parse-A-Document-(Old-API)).

# How to Build #

yaml-cpp uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) to support cross-platform building. The basic steps to build are:

1. Download and install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) (Resources -> Download).

**Note:** If you don't use the provided installer for your platform, make sure that you add CMake's bin folder to your path.

2. Navigate into the source directory, and type:

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Run CMake. The basic syntax is:

```
cmake [-G generator] [-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON|OFF] ..
```

  * The `generator` is whatever type of build system you'd like to use. To see a full list of generators on your platform, just run `cmake` (with no arguments). For example:
    * On Windows, you might use "Visual Studio 12 2013" to generate a Visual Studio 2013 solution or "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" to generate a 64-bit Visual Studio 2015 solution.
    * On OS X, you might use "Xcode" to generate an Xcode project
    * On a UNIX-y system, simply omit the option to generate a makefile
  * yaml-cpp defaults to building a static library, but you may build a shared library by specifying `-DYAML_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`.
  * For more options on customizing the build, see the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) file.

4. Build it!

5. To clean up, just remove the `build` directory.

### Cross Compile Dynamic Library for Android

* The 3rd step above can do like this:

  ```
  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${NDKROOT}/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_STL=c++_shared -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-26 -DANDROID_ABI=x86_64 -DBUILD_ANDROID_LIBS=ON ..
  ```

  - To do cross-compiling, `ndk-bundle`OR `android-sdk` is needed. Also `NDKROOT` should be exported in your `bash` config file, just like:

    ```
    export NDKROOT=~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk-bundle
    ```

  - The arguments `ANDROID_ABI` can be set to `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `armeabi`, `x86`, `x86_64`ï¼Œ etc. If NOT set, the default value is `armeabi-v7a`.
  
- The arguments `ANDROID_PLATFORM` can be set to `android-xx` OR `latest`, `xx` can be replaced to the android api number, the default value will be the minimum supported version of your `ndk-bundle`, while the value `latest` will using the maximum supported version.
  
  -  `BUILD_ANDROID_LIBS=ON` will default set `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`, and copy the `libc++_shared.so` to `build` directory from `ndk-bundle`, which maybe needed by `libyaml-cpp.so`.
  
   

# Recent Release #

[yaml-cpp 0.6.0](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/releases/tag/yaml-cpp-0.6.0) has been released! This release requires C++11, and no longer depends on Boost.

[yaml-cpp 0.3.0](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp/releases/tag/release-0.3.0) is still available if you want the old API.

**The old API will continue to be supported, and will still receive bugfixes!** The 0.3.x and 0.4.x versions will be old API releases, and 0.5.x and above will all be new API releases.
